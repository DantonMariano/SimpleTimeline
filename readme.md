# Airtable timeline assignment

- What you like about your implementation.

I really like the fact that, although the solution is simple, it's an elegant fix to the issue. I sacrificed some functionality because I believed I wouldn't be able to deliver the full product, with all its features, while maintaining a polished and bug-free experience.

- What you would change if you were going to do it again.

If I were to approach this again, I would start by gaining a better understanding of the issue. While developing, I realized that the items had end dates, which would have been better suited for a horizontally-oriented timeline with a calendar view. I attempted this approach unsuccessfully and decided to return to a vertical timeline, focusing on start dates instead.

- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.

I reviewed some of the timelines featured on the AWWWARDS website for inspiration. Based on what I saw, I decided to implement Lenis for smooth scrolling with GSAP, and added simple 3D animations to enhance the scrolling effect.

- How you would test this if you had more time.

I would test for potential responsiveness issues that could arise with the animations. Additionally, I would evaluate the overall design and user experience to ensure that the website is both functional and user-friendly across different devices.
