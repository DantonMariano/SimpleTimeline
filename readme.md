# Airtable timeline assignment

- What you like about your implementation.
I really enjoy the fact that even though it's simple, it's an ellegant fix to the issue, I've sacrificed some functionality because I believe I wouldn't be able to deliver the full product working with all its features while looking good and free of bugs.
- What you would change if you were going to do it again.
I'd change my approach to the issue by starting with a better interpretation of the issue, while I was developing I found out that the items had date ends which means that they would be better used in horizontal fashioned timeline with a calendar. (i've tried this approach unsuccesffuly and decided to go back to the vertical timeline with start dates)
- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
I've taken a look at some of the timelines available in the AWWWARDS websites, and decided to implement lenis with GSAP for smoothscroll while having simple 3d animations for the scroll effect
- How you would test this if you had more time.
I'd test for responsivity issues that could come up with the animations as well as the whole design website to see if its user friendly.
